Required image files for the game:

- planet.png (exact size: 60x60px)
  - The planet is drawn at 60x60px (radius * 2)
  - Should be a circular image with transparent background

- cannon.png (exact size: 40x10px)
  - The cannon is drawn at 40x10px (length x width)
  - Should be a horizontal image with transparent background
  - Base of cannon should be at left edge

- background.png (optional, size: 800x800px)
  - Currently not implemented, but structure is in place
  - Can be added later for custom background

All images should be PNG format with transparency where needed.
Images will be scaled if not exact size, but these dimensions are optimal.
